An example classification algorithm using Bayes is shown below, using petal and sepal measurements of three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)/[Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other. The below bayesian classifier in R will show an example of classifying each species based on petal and sepal measurements.
