> The name of the problem comes from the host for a game show called "Let's Make a Deal" and involves a part of the show where a contestant could potentially win a new car. The rules are this: The contestant is given the choice of 3 closed doors. Behind one of the doors is the new car, and behind the other two is a goat (the booby prize). The player chooses one door, after which the host, Monty Hall opens one of the other doors, always the one with a goat. Monty Hall then offers the contestant the option to switch doors to the other unopened door as their final play. Whether the contestant switches or not, the game ends with all three doors open. If the player's door has the car behind it, then they've won the game.
